Car Rental Management System(CRMS) allows a person to book/reserve vehicle with or without payment on one end and add vehicles and put them up for rent while the admin handles the transactions, on the other via the internet.
The basic function of our car rental system is to keep track of vehicles, customers and booking. It provides useful information about the cars and acts as a vehicle managment system by monitoring the use and price of the vehicles.
Some of the main features included in our application are:
- Multi-status user management
- user friendly car search and addition management
- flexible reservation and waiting list
- Payment management
- Feedback and reports
